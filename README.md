### About Me!
I am a third year college student taking CS-HU250 to learn how to use github.
I love engineering, and I am working towards a major in *Computer Systems Engineering*.
I also dabble in art which was another thing that drew me to engineering as engineering is
a fun way to bring ideas and images to life!
